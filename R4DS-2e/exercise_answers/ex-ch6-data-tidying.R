# 1. For each of the sample tables, describe what each observation 
#    and each column represents.

# table 1 - each column represents a variable while each row is an observation

# table 2 - like table 1 except "type" column mixes up two kinds of data.

# table 3 - column 'rate' is a calculated field containing two variables that 
#  should be managed as separate columns

# 2. Sketch out the process youâ€™d use to calculate the rate for table2 and table3. 
#   You will need to perform four operations:

# a. Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.

# b. Extract the matching population per country per year.
# c. Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.
# d. Store back in the appropriate place.
